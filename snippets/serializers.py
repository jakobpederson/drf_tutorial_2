# Creating a Serializer class
# The first thing we need to get started on our Web API is to provide a way of serializing and deserializing the snippet
# instances into representations such as json. We can do this by declaring serializers that work very similar to Djangos
# forms. Create a file in the snippets directory named serializers.py and add the following.

from rest_framework import serializers
from snippets.models import Snippet, LANGUAGE_CHOICES, STYLE_CHOICES


class SnippetSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    id = serializers.IntegerField(read_only=True)
    title = serializers.CharField(required=False, allow_blank=True, max_length=100)
    code = serializers.CharField(style={'base_template': 'textarea.html'})
    linenos = serializers.BooleanField(required=False)
    language = serializers.ChoiceField(choices=LANGUAGE_CHOICES, default='friendly')

    def create(self, validated_data):
        return Snippet.objects.create(**validated_data)

    def update(self, instance, validated_data):
        instance.title = validated_data.get('title', instance.title)
        instance.code = validated_data.get('code', instance.code)
        instance.linenos = validated_data.get('linenos', instance.linenos)
        instance.language = validated_data.get('language', instance.language)
        instance.style = validated_data.get('style', instance.style)
        instance.save()
        return instance

#  The first part of the serializer class defines the fields that get serialized/deserialized. The create() and
#  update() methods define how fully fledged instances are created or modified when calling serializer.save()
#  A serializer class is very similar to a Django Form class, and includes similar validation flags on the various
#  fields, such as required, max_length and default.

#  The field flags can also control how the serializer should be displayed in certain circumstances, such as when
#  rendering to HTML. The {'base_template': 'textarea.html'} flag above is equivalent to using widget=widgets.Textarea
#  on a Django Form class. This is particularly useful for controlling how the browsable API should be displayed, as

#  we'll see later in the tutorial.
#  We can actually also save ourselves some time by using the ModelSerializer class, as we'll see later, but for now
#  we'll keep our serializer definition explicit.
